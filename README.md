## Examining Changes

The Specification is tracked using [git](http://git-scm.com/). Various tools are available for showing the differences between commits in a git repository and they can be used to examine changes to the Specification. However, the HTML rendering of the Specification that is included in the repository is not suitable for tracking changes to the contents of the Specification.
