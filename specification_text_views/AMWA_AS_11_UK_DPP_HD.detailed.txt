# AS-11: Media Contribution File Formats

The AMWA AS-11 Specifications define constrained media file formats for the delivery of finished media assets to a broadcaster or publisher. Each Specification is developed for a particular business purpose.


# Purpose of the AS-11 UK DPP HD Specification

## Aims

This Specification aims to define a file format for the delivery of finished HD TV Programmes to UK [Digital Production Partnership](https://www.digitalproductionpartnership.co.uk/) (DPP) broadcasters. It aims to define:

* a vendor-neutral and broadcaster-neutral package, using open technologies for delivery of finished programming from program producers and program distributors to broadcast stations
* a package that is sufficiently simple so as to limit the scope for interoperability problems
* a self-contained & play-out ready package

## Some notes on practical use

* The content may be delivered at the broadcast bit-rate, picture format and aspect ratio, or it may be transcoded at the broadcast station to the bit-rates and formats required for particular broadcast channels. Similar transcoding may be applied to audio and captions; additionally, specific audio and caption tracks may be selected for different broadcast channels.
* The content may be pre-packaged for broadcast without further changes or it may be segmented for ease of insertion or replacement of interstitials.
* There may be more than one package per programme.
* The package may contain some pre and post roll content not for transmission.


# Understanding the Specification Blocks Tree

## The Rules-Based Specification Framework
This Specification has been written using a 'Rules-based Specification Framework'. In this framework, each 'constraint' or 'rule' is expressed as a 'Component' which can be unambiguously identified by its ID (the Component ID is a web address / URL; there need not be any content available at this web address). These Components assemble into 'networks' or 'webs' to form complete Specifications, with many Components being re-used across a number of Specifications. Through this approach machine processable Specifications are developed which are less ambiguous and easier to implement and test. To read a more detailed introduction to the Rules-based Specification Framework refer to [Rules-Based Specifications: Modelling and Processing](http://www.bbc.co.uk/rd/publications/whitepaper319).

* **Blocks (B)** are the fundamental 'building bricks' of a Specification -- they provide its _structure_.
* A Block can either link to **Artefacts (A)** that it 'owns' or link to other Blocks.
* Artefacts provide the real _content_ of a Specification. They may contain textual statements, code excerpts, or tables, for example.
* Artefacts often refer to **Terms (T)** and **References (R)** as well as Blocks.
* Blocks are sometimes described by **Notes (N)**.
* There are two special types of Block which allow the value of one Block to be set by another Block:
    * **Parameter Key Block (K)** -- this is a Block whose value must be set elsewhere in the Specification (it effectively defines a "variable" or an "argument").
    * **Parameter Value Block (V)** -- this is a Block which sets the value of a specific Parameter Key Block.

In this document the network of Blocks (and other Components) that form the Specification are shown as a 'tree': the Specification Blocks Tree. The letters in brackets above are used in the tree to identify the different kinds of Component.

## Conformance

An implementation complies with this Specification if it complies with the Components from which it is constructed, as shown in the Specification Blocks Tree, subject to the following provisions:

* An implementation complies with a Block if it complies with all of the normative Components from which it is constructed. "Informative" items (as defined below) do not have to be complied with.
* "Note" Components are considered "informative". All other Components are considered "normative" unless otherwise noted.
* Compliance with some Blocks is not mandatory. Such Blocks are marked with an alternative "conformance" state (such as "optional" or "recommended").
* The name / title of a Component is considered "informative".
* Prose Artefacts are written as statements of fact. An implementation complies with one of these Artefacts if the stated fact is True for the implementation.
* Other Artefacts are "data files" (such as SMPTE Metadata Registers XML files or XML Schema files). Some of these may be _partially_ rendered below. An implementation must always fully comply with these data files -- links are provided to such data files in the Specification Blocks Tree.
* Note that an Artefact does not always make sense on its own: all of the Artefacts contained within a Block need to be read (in order) to understand the Block fully and correctly.

        [N] Indexing and Partitions
            <Component ID: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/007/>
            [A] It's generally considered good MXF practice to have one 'thing' per Partition, so you'd have separate Partitions for Header Metadata, Essence, and Index Tables. This isn't a requirement but following best practice is encouraged.
                
                The Index Table could be placed in the Header Partition, its own Body Partition or in a Body Partition with the Essence. Indeed it could be distributed across all three of these locations. Decoders need to be able to cope with all of these posibilities.

            [A] This really does matter because of the separation of the physical from the logical in MXF files. Without this, decoders can only identify tracks by their track ID or the physical order in the file, which is not otherwise constrained in MXF.
                
                This applies to Material Package Sound Tracks, not those in the Source Package.
                
                This differs from the suggestion in Annex B of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011 that the Track Number be set to zero for all Material Package Tracks.

                [N] Implementation Notes

                    [A] # Use of Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage
                        
                        The file can use Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream Carriage to carry audio presentation metadata for zero, one or more than one SoundfieldGroups / Audio Programs.
                        
                        # SDID value
                        
                        SMPTE ST 2020-1 specifies that the SDID value within the VANC Data Packet be used to identify the Sound Tracks that make up the Audio Program. For example, VANC Data Packets that contain Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream for a 5.1 channel Audio Program starting at channel pair 5/6 will require the SDID value in the VANC Data Packet to be set to 04h.
                        
                        However, this approach only works inside an MXF file if every Audio Channel in the file is identifiable using a pan-file channel number. This is the case if, for example, the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are numbered mono Sound Tracks.
                        
                        However, if the Sound Tracks in the MXF file are Multichannel Sound Tracks then this approach does not work. Some consequences of this:
                        
                        * The value to be used for SDID is undefined.
                        * If more than one 5.1 SoundfieldGroup (and at least one Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream) is included in the file then an external mechanism is needed to relate SoundfieldGroups and Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams.
                        * The SDID values might need to be rewritten upon output so that they correctly identify the Audio Channels that are being used to carry the relevant SoundfieldGroup / Audio Program. For example, this might be the case when playing out an MXF file to SDI -- particularly if only certain audio is played out or the audio layout is changed.
                        
                        # DID value
                        
                        VANC Data Packets that are carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstream will have a DID value of 45h.
                        
                        # Packets are not constant throughout
                        
                        SMPTE 2020-B requires that there is "one packet in each field of interlaced video formats". However, the two packets in each interlaced video frame are not identical.
                        
                        The values of SMPTE RDD 6 metadata properties might change from one frame to the next, but normally they will not. However, the VANC Data Packets in the file will not be identical even if the metadata is static: the "frame_count" will certainly increment and the "description_text" (if not null) will change.
                        
                        # Other data being carried in the ANC Frame Element
                        
                        The ANC Frame Element can also contain HANC Data Packets and other VANC Data Packets in addition to those carrying Dolby E Audio Metadata Serial Bitstreams. Irrespective of what data is carried in the ANC Frame Element, there is only ever one Track (in each of the Material Package and Top-Level File Package), one Data Element, and one associated Essence Descriptor in the MXF file.

                <Component ID: http://www.amwa.tv/projects/rules/01/note/E69/>
                [A] Care must be taken when dealing with numbers expressed as a ratio of two integers ("rationals"). They are often used to represent temporal rates or image aspect ratios.
                    
                    When making comparisons of these values, it is insufficient to simply compare each of the numerators and each of the denominators. For example, `7/5` is mathematically equal to `14/10`.

# Metadata Constraints as Python Artefacts: Specification Format Definition

This Section defines how Python Artefacts (expressing metadata constraints) in this Specification are to be interpreted.

Each Python Artefact defines checks / tests using [Python](https://www.python.org/) version 2.7. An implementation complies with a Python Artefact if it passes all of the checks / tests that the Artefact specifies. Note that the code has been designed to enhance the clarity of the test definitions rather than for efficient or compact code.

Each relevant MXF Element / property is represented as a Python variable:

* The name of the variable is set as the `Symbol` of the Element / property.
* The value of the variable must be `None` (i.e. the special Python object) if the Element / property is considered to be "absent" from the relevant KLV set in the MXF file (an Element / property is considered to be "present" in the MXF file if its 2-byte tag is present in the relevant KLV set in the MXF file and it is considered to be "absent" otherwise). Otherwise the value stored in the MXF file must be converted into the relevant Python data type (see below).

## Data Types

### UTF16String
Values of Type `UTF16String` are stored as Python Unicode strings. `UTF16String` values are assumed to have been read from the MXF file according to Section 4.3 of SMPTE ST 377-1:2011, terminating before (and discarding) any null character. Note that no other characters appearing before the null character (such as whitespace or non-printable characters) are removed. If an Element / property of type `UTF16String` is considered "present" but the above processing of the value stored in the MXF file results in zero characters in the string, the corresponding variable shall be assigned the value `""` (the empty string).

### Integers
All signed and unsigned integer types used in MXF are represented as Python integers.

### Booleans
The values of MXF Booleans are represented by the Python values `True` and `False`.

### Record Types
Any value of a "Record" Type (a Type with `TypeKind` of `Record`) is represented as a Python Dictionary. For each `Facet` (constituent part) an item is added to the Python Dictionary with a key equal to that of the `Symbol` of the `Facet`. The value for this key is set to the parsed value of the relevant portion of the Element / property value.

### Enumerations
For each `Facet` (allowed value) of an "Enumeration" Type (a Type with `TypeKind` of `Enumeration`) a Python variable is defined with:

* a name equal to that of the `Facet` `Symbol`
* a value equal to that of the `Facet` `Value`

## Helper Functions

The following helper functions are used in the Python Artefacts. They have been designed to enhance clarity rather than for efficient or compact code.

```
def CHECK(condition):
    """
    Check that the provided 'condition' (Boolean) is True.

    If the provided 'condition' is False this is a 'Fail' -- the implementation
    does not comply with the constraint.
   
    """

    try:
        assert condition == True
    except AssertionError:
        print "Check failed -- compliance has not been achieved"

```

```
def PRESENT(variable):
    """
    Return a Boolean to indicate whether the Element / property represented by
    the 'variable' is present in the MXF file.
    
    'Presence' of an Element / property is determined by the presence of its
    2-byte tag in the relevant KLV set in the MXF file. The Python variable
    representing an MXF Element / property is assumed to be None if, and
    only if, that Element / property is considered not present in the MXF file.

    """

    if variable is not None:
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
